### installing R
# 1. Edit /etc/apt/sources.list to include the following line:
# for 14.04
deb http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/
# for 12.04
deb http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/bin/linux/ubuntu precise/
# the part before /bin may be changed for a different mirror

# 2. Get the key with
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E084DAB9
# 3. Then:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base

### disable text box on the desktop
# 1. Install gnome-tweak-tool: sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
# 2. Open 'gnome-tweak-tool'
# 3. Under Desktop, swtich 'Have file manager handle the desktop' to
#    off.

### disable update manager
# 1. Run this line in bash
sudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop
# 2. Go to 'Startup Application' (12.04, not sure where in 14.04)
# 3. Uncheck the box next to 'Update Manager'
# 4. Open 'Update Manager' and change check for updates to 'Never'

# An explanation for the above command: The *.desktop files in the
# /etc/xdg/autostart directory are the launchers for each listed
# process, and some but not all of them contain the line
# "NoDisplay=true" to prevent them from being displayed in the
# Autostart dialog. His command simply changes that line from "true"
# to "false" in any desktop file that contains it, so that all of the
# launchers appear in the dialog and can be enabled or disabled.

### clean up the home directory
# 1. Run the command:
sed -i 's/HOME\/[A-Z].*/HOME\/downloads/' ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs
# to set all those default directories to ~/downloads.
# 2. Remove every non hidden directory in ~/ with (be careful)
#find ~ -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -path '*/\.*' -name '[A-Z]*' -exec rm -rf {} \;
# 3. Create directories:
mkdir ~/bin ~/downloads ~/files
# 4. Make necessary changes in web browser (such as where to download)

### change system settings
# Appearance: download awesome space-related image, and put it in
#   /usr/share/backgrounds (may need sudo privileges), then remove all
#   those nasty default backgrounds, smalled launcher icon size
#   under Behavior: auto-hide launcher on, reveal location top left, low
#   sensitivity
#   (dash can be accessed with the super key, or the windows key)
# Brightness and Lock: screen off never, lock off
# Privacy: under Files, do not record activity
# Keyboard: under Typing: make delay at about 1/6 the length and speed
#   on fastest. under Shortcuts: disable nearly everything
#   launch terminal: ctrl + T
#   web browser: shift + ctrl + C
#   workspace, move window: shift + ctrl + (vi keys)
#   workspace, move around: ctrl + alt + (vi keys)
#   vol down: ctrl + F11
